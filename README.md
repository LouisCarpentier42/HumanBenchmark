Since the dawn of time, humans have sought to prove their intellectual 
prowess, outshining one another in feats of memory, reaction, and 
problem-solving. The [Human Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/)
stands as a modern battleground for these cerebral showdowns. But 
the age of unchallenged human dominance is over. Machines have emerged, 
relentless and tireless, as rivals in the race for intellectual 
supremacy. This repository is dedicated to crafting methods that 
shatter records, obliterate benchmarks, and showcase the undeniable 
superiority of computers. Let the showdown begin.

| Benchmark       | Description | Points | Percentile | Time |

| Reaction Time   |             |        |            |      |
| Visual Memory   |             |        |            |      |
| Number memory   |             |        |            |      |
| Verbal Memory   |             |        |            |      |
| Typing          |             |        |            |      |
| Aim Timer       |             |        |            |      |
| Chimp Test      |             |        |            |      |
| Sequence Memory |             |        |            |      |
